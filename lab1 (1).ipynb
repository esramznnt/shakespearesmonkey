The speed of insertion sort will be higher than the speed of quicksort for the small numbers. A base case which is equal to the intersection of these two sorting algorithm graphs will run faster, since the algorithms runs quicksort where quicksort is faster than insertion sort and runs insertion sort where insertion sort is faster.\n",
