    "Add a constructor \n",

    "__init__(self, filename, delimiter)\n",
    "```\n",
    "to the class ```ordered_dict```.\n",

    "\n",
    "In case the file contains some lines with another format (for example a final line with just a new line character) you can test for *len equal to two* after spliting a line to decide whether the line had an item to add to the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the function ```random_phone_numbers``` to generate a file with 10 entries. \n",
    "2. Use the function ```small_test``` to check that the constructor worked: are all the names and numbers from the file <tt>telephone_numbers</tt> in the dictionary ```tels```?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exercise 2\n",
    "Program a function \n",
    "```Python \n",
    "   save_ordered_dict(d, filename, delimiter)\n",
    "```\n",
    "that uses the iterator from the class ```ordered_dict``` to save all items in ```d``` to the file ```filename``` using ```delimiter``` to separate key from value in the file. Write one item per line in the same format that is expected by the constructor.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the function ```random_phone_numbers``` to generate a file with 10 entries. \n",
    "2. Use the function ```read_save_read``` and check that all items in the file  <tt>tr</tt> are the items from the file <tt>telephone_numbers</tt>.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exercise 3\n",
    "(This is not a programming exercise). \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explain why, given that the items in  the file <tt>tr</tt> are the items in the  file <tt>telephone_numbers</tt>, the ordered dictionary ```tels``` constructed from <tt>tr</tt> has a larger height than the one constructed from <tt>telephone_numbers</tt>. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use the function ```manySearches(10000, read_save_read)``` . Explain why the searches take more time when constructing the dictionary form the file <tt>tr</tt> than from the file <tt>telephone_numbers</tt>.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exercise 4\n",
    "Add a method \n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "save(self, filename, delimiter)\n",
    "```\n",
    "to the class to the class ```ordered_dict```. The method should improve on the function we defined outside the class in two ways. It should not construct an intermediate list (as ```__iter__``` does) and it should write to the file in so called **pre order**: first the key and value in the root, then all values to the left and finally all values to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the function ```random_phone_numbers``` to generate a file with 10 entries. \n",
    "2. Use the function ```read_save_meth_read``` to test that all items in the file  <tt>tr</tt> are the items from the file <tt>telephone_numbers</tt>.\n",
    "3. Use the function ```manySearches(10000, read_save_meth_read)``` to see that the execution time for searches is approximately the same for both dictionaries.\n"
